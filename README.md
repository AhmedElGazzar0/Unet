This project is proposed in the context of MLMI practical course. The students are required to implement the given paper, namely HeMIS [1]. To do so, the students need to implememnt the back-end CNN proposed here [2]. 


The proposed WorkPackages:  

WP1: Back-End Implementation (FCN U-Net[3]/CNN[2]) including the validation on different modalities 
WP2: Implement the Hetero-Modal for Image Segmentation including the abstraction layer and the front-end layers
WP3: Intensive validation on both clinical datasets
WP4: Working further on the abstraction layer (optional)
